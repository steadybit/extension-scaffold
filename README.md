# Steadybit Extension Scaffold

This repository contains a scaffold with a sample implementation of a [Steadybit extension](https://docs.steadybit.com/integrate-with-steadybit/extensions). You may find this repository helpfulâ€¦

## Understanding the Extension Mechanism

One of the best ways to understand the extension mechanism is to run an extension and experiment with its APIs. We have prepared Gitpod and GitHub codespaces setups to make this as easy as possible for you.

When you click one of these buttons, you will be directed to an online editor with a locally running extension, and the file `README.http` will open. This file contains documentation and HTTP calls you can execute to learn about extensions and this specific sample implementation.

## Getting started

Make sure that you're in the root of the project directory, fetch the dependencies with `go mod tidy`, then run the application using `go run ./cmd/web`:

```
$ go mod tidy
$ go run ./cmd/web
```

Then visit [http://localhost:4444](http://localhost:4444) in your browser.

## Configuration settings



## Admin tasks

The `Makefile` in the project root contains commands to easily run common admin tasks:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| `$ make tidy` | Format all code using `go fmt` and tidy the `go.mod` file. |
| `$ make audit` | Run `go vet`, `staticheck`, execute all tests and verify required modules. |
| `$ make build` | Build a binary for the `cmd/web` application and store it in the `bin` folder. |
| `$ make run` | Build and then run a binary for the `cmd/web` application. |

## Changing the module path

The module path is currently set to `foobar`. If you want to change this please find and replace all instances of `foobar` in the codebase with your own module path.
